## Style Guidelines:

- Light teal (#90E0EF). Evokes feelings of calm, clarity, and innovation. It references the transparency of glassmorphism, the color of the AI glow, and also contrasts beautifully with a darker background.
- Dark, desaturated purple (#34304D). Complements the light teal, while providing a sophisticated, modern base. The choice of purple adds a touch of creativity and aligns with GenZ aesthetics.
- Light purple (#C084FC). Used for highlights and interactive elements, it adds a playful yet sophisticated touch. It contrasts with the background and is analogous to the teal.
- 'Poppins', sans-serif. The geometric style and contemporary look pair well with glassmorphism and neon aesthetics. Suitable for headlines and shorter amounts of text.
- 'PT Sans', sans-serif. The font choice adds warmth while retaining readability, and ensuring the visual design does not appear overly harsh.
- Glowing icons using the primary and accent colors. In the style of the provided example, icons will appear embossed or debossed based on their light source within the glassmorphism effect.
- Glassmorphism overlays, rounded corners (24px), and a focus on clear, intuitive layouts. Mimic the general layout and component styles of the UI you provided, without exactly replicating it.
- Smooth fade and slide animations
